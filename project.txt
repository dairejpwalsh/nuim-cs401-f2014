NUIM CS 401 (Fall 2014) Project

Instead of coding something up, the objective of this project is to
produce a report describing and assessing a practical machine learning
application which received attention in the media.

The report length is flexible, but I'd anticipate three or four pages,
not including figures and tables and images and such.

The report should include the following:

 * pointer to articles in the media on the system (with quotes as needed)
 * brief description of the system
   - what it does
   - why it received attention
   - what you found interesting about it
 * in-depth technical description (may require looking at technical literature)
   - technical description of the problem
   - details on the dataset (size, nature, source, etc)
   - details on how the data was pre-processed for the machine
     learning algorithms
   - details on the machine learning methods being applied
     + basic algorithm
     + novel twists or tweaks
     + size of the network or system (if applicable)
     + time & number of CPUs used for training
     + etc
 * criticisms of the system, if any
 * discussion of things you might consider doing differently
 * discussion of possible extensions
 * any points you'd like to make that don't fit into the above

For example, the "deep learning" network that recently was reported to
have dramatically improved the performance of speech recognition at
Great Big Company Inc would be an appropriate choice.  How big was the
improvement?  What was it attributed to?  How was the input speech
waveform encoded for presentation to the network?
